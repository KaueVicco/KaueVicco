Hello, my name is Kaue and I am 19 years old. I was born and raised
in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo, Brazil. I graduated from High
School in 2021. At the end of 2022, I have been accepted at
Valencia College. Since then, I moved to the United States to get
further education and started to take A.A. classes focusing on
Computer Science. My expected graduation date from Valencia
College is in the Summer of 2025. After graduating from Valencia
College, I am planning to transfer to a university and pursue a
Computer Science Bachelor’s Degree.
