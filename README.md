# Hi, there! ✌️

👋 Hey! I'm Kaue — a 20-year-old aspiring software developer passionate about technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning.

🌍 I was born and raised in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo, Brazil. In 2022, I moved to the United States to pursue higher education and broaden my horizons. I recently completed my Associate in Arts (A.A.) degree in Computer Science at Valencia College, Florida. After graduation in May 2025, I returned to São Paulo to continue my academic and professional journey.

🎯 I'm currently preparing for my Bachelor's in Computer Science and building hands-on experience with real-world projects. My focus areas include back-end development, APIs, and cloud services.
